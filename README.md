OpenLab
=======

# What
OpenLab's goal is to provide lab equipment users a fully customizable interface for controlling and collecting data from their equipment (either serial, or analog).

# How
OpenLab's focus is on providing an extensive plugin framework for customizing the software to users' applications. For interfacing with non-serial devices, a microcontroller can be used. OpenLab comes with sample code for interfacing the software with an Arduino.

# Why
Existing software for communicating with lab equipment is pricey, clumsy, and closed source. Our goal is to change that. Since everyones' applications will differ, an extensive plugin framework is necessary. Our hope is that contributors will share their plugins with the community.

# When
This project is aimed for alpha release by the end of August 2014. However, all of the features we anticipate implementing may not be implemented by then. Keep checking in!
